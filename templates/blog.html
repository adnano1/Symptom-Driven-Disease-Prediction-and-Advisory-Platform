      <h2 class="text-center">Building a Symptom-Driven Disease Prediction and Advisory Platform Web App with Flask and ML</h2>

      <p>
        In this project we designed and built a compact, explainable web application that predicts likely diseases from user-reported symptoms and supplies contextual, non-prescriptive guidance (description, precautions, suggested medicines, diet and workout tips). The app is a student-built academic prototype that emphasizes reproducibility, interpretability and lightweight deployment so it can run with minimal infrastructure and be used for demonstrations, teaching or pilot testing.
      </p>

      <h3>The Problem</h3>
      <p>
        Many lay users lack a reliable, explainable first-line tool to triage symptoms - existing symptom-checkers can be opaque or inconsistent, and professional clinical access is not always immediate in resource-constrained settings. Users find it hard to interpret which symptom combinations matter, and clinicians need tools that summarise likely causes without hiding the model's limitations.
      </p>

      <h3>The Solution</h3>
      <p>
        We built a Flask-served web application that accepts comma-separated symptom input, converts those symptoms into a fixed binary feature vector (presence = 1, absence = 0), and feeds that vector to a compact multi-class Support Vector Classifier (SVC) trained on curated symptom→disease records. The server returns the top prediction and uses CSV-backed lookup tables to display a disease description, recommended precautions, curated medication suggestions (informational only), dietary advice and simple workout guidance.
      </p>

      <p>
        The solution was designed around three practical goals: (1) interpretability - symptom encoding and CSV lookup tables make behavior transparent; (2) lightweight deployment - the trained model is serialized to `svc.pkl` and loaded by Flask for quick inference; and (3) explicit safety - the UI and documentation clearly state that the system provides probabilistic suggestions and is not a diagnostic replacement for clinicians.
      </p>

      <h3>Key Features</h3>
      <ul type="circle">
        <li><strong>Explainable pipeline:</strong> symptom→index mapping to binary vectors and CSV-based content (descriptions, precautions, meds, diets, workouts) so outputs can be inspected and reproduced.</li>
        <li><strong>Compact SVC model:</strong> a multi-class Support Vector Classifier trained with cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning; the final model is serialized for deployment.</li>
        <li><strong>Flask backend & API:</strong> endpoints for the homepage, `/predict` POST route for inference, and static pages (about, blog, developer, contact); CSV resources are loaded at startup for efficient lookup.</li>
        <li><strong>User-friendly frontend:</strong> responsive Jinja2 + Bootstrap templates that show predictions and contextual guidance with modal dialogs for details.</li>
        <li><strong>Evaluation & ethics:</strong> standard metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1, confusion matrices) and an explicit limitations section emphasizing data provenance, potential false positives/negatives, and the need for clinical confirmation.</li>
        <li><strong>Data confidentiality:</strong> datasets used in model development are handled under strict confidentiality constraints and are used for academic research and evaluation only (see dataset terms on the site).</li>
      </ul>

      <br>

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>
        This project demonstrates a full pipeline from curated symptom datasets to a deployed, interpretable ML web application suitable for demonstration and academic evaluation. The system highlights how a simple, transparent ML model combined with curated content can act as an early triage aid - while clearly deferring final diagnosis and treatment decisions to qualified medical professionals.
      </p>

      <h3>Team & Roles</h3>
      <p>
        Developed by a group of three Indian students. Roles were divided to combine strengths across data, model and engineering:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Adnan Hashmi</strong> - data preprocessing, feature engineering, model evaluation, documentation and frontend support.</li>
        <li><strong>Daksh Khosla</strong> - model training (SVC), hyperparameter tuning, model serialization and Flask backend/API integration.</li>
        <li><strong>Priyanshu Singh</strong> - backend integration, frontend UI/UX, result presentation, testing and user-acceptance validation.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="small text-muted">
        Note: The project is a prototype that provides probabilistic suggestions and should not be used for clinical decision-making. For details on datasets, preprocessing steps, model evaluation and deployment, see the project synopsis and abstract in the documentation.
