      <h3>About Us</h3>
      <p>
        We are a student-built, lightweight machine-learning web application that helps non-specialist users understand likely diseases based on self-reported symptoms and offers contextual, non-prescriptive guidance (descriptions, precautions, suggested medications, diet and workout suggestions). The system uses a compact, explainable model and CSV-backed content so it can run with minimal infrastructure and provide immediate, transparent feedback to end users.
      </p>

      <h3>Our Vision</h3>
      <p>
        We envision a future where basic, reliable primary health guidance is accessible to everyone - especially users in resource-constrained settings. Rather than replacing clinicians, our aim is to bridge the gap between symptom awareness and timely clinical consultation by offering an explainable, easy-to-use first line of triage and advice.
      </p>

      <h3>Who We Are</h3>
      <p>
        We are a team of three Indian students collaborating on this project: <strong style="color: #DB2777;">Adnan Hashmi</strong>, <strong style="color: #DB2777;">Daksh Khosla</strong>, and <strong style="color: #DB2777;">Priyanshu Singh</strong>. Together we combine skills in data preprocessing, machine learning, backend engineering, and frontend UI/UX to deliver a practical, deployable prototype.
      </p>

      <h3>Our Mission</h3>
      <p>
        Our mission is to build and deploy a robust, interpretable symptom→disease prediction system that is lightweight enough to host via Flask, transparent in its inputs and outputs, and useful for early triage. We prioritise explainability, practical utility, and clear communication of limitations so that users can make informed choices and seek clinical care when appropriate.
      </p>

      <h3>How We Do It</h3>
      <p>
        Users enter symptoms which are encoded as a fixed binary feature vector (presence = 1, absence = 0). A multi-class Support Vector Classifier (SVC) trained on curated symptom data predicts the most likely disease label. The Flask backend loads the serialized model and CSV lookup resources at startup and serves predictions plus curated content (disease description, precautions, suggested medications, diet and workout guidance) to the frontend for immediate display.
      </p>

      <h3>Your Well-being, Our Priority</h3>
      <p>
        This tool provides probabilistic suggestions and guidance - it is explicitly <em>not</em> a diagnostic system. We clearly communicate limitations (false positives/negatives, dataset representativeness) and advise users to seek qualified clinical confirmation for medical decisions. Data privacy and ethical use are core considerations in our design and documentation.
      </p>

      <h3>Join Us on this Journey</h3>
      <p>
        Explore the app, try the prediction interface, and share feedback. We welcome collaboration for rigorous evaluation, pilot deployments, and partnerships that enable clinical validation under appropriate approvals.
